# The-Archmage-Demo

A demo for the interactive fiction game "The Archmage" which is currently under private development. 

Any developers interested in working with me on this project can contact me @thearchmagedev@gmail.com to express their interest.

This project is being developed in Twine 2.0 (SugarCube).

It is a text-based interactive fiction (CYOA) game with a fantasy story of my personal creation.

The primary goal of this game is to provide each player with a unique narrative experience based on their personality and decisions.

In order to achieve that goal, the game will be developed to provide a massive amount of control to the player such that their choices matter.

The secondary goal of this game is to provide a "realistic" experience for the player. What this means is not that it will resemble non-fiction (there will be fictional elements), but rather that no subject matter is off limits. Players should be warned that this may create uncomfortable plot developments.

The scope of the main project will inevitably be large. As such, the development process will take a long time... I hope to finish before I die.

The purpose of this demo to provide a proof of concept and also tease the players without ruining the story.

This is my first game development project, so I may require some grace from time to time.
