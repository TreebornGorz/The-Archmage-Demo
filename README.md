This is a demo for the currently in-development interactive fiction project "The Archmage", a project intended to be a narrative-driven interactive fiction fantasy game which provides the player with //significant// agency and //significant// replayability.

This demo provides players with a teaser for the main project. It is intended to display gameplay without widening the scope to unwieldy levels inevitably required for developing the main project. 

The final version of the demo will contain: multiple endings, //moderate// replayability, environmental interactions, and //significant// player agency. 

The main project contains adult (NSFW) content in order to make player agency //realistic//. Publishing will begin when the demo is complete.

Players may contact me @thearchmagedev@gmail.com

Notes: This project is inspired by Zork. Interactive Fiction engines give players a great deal of agency, but generally lack a developed narrative. Visual novels contain developed narratives but often //rob players of their agency//. My dream is to combine these elements in a single project. 

Version: Alpha v0.1.2
Description: This version is pre-Alpha. It contains a few endings, //limited// replayability, //basic// environmental interactions, and //limited// player agency. Some paths are incomplete.
