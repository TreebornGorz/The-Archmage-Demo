This is a demo for the currently in-development interactive fiction project "The Archmage", a project intended to be a narrative-driven interactive fiction fantasy which provides the player with _significant_ agency.

This demo provides players with a teaser for the main project without spoiling major story elements. It is intended to display gameplay mechanics without widening the scope (and timeline) to unwieldy levels inevitably required for developing the main project. 

The final version of the demo will contain: Multiple Endings, Replayability, Environmental Interactions, and Basic Agency. 

I expect the main project to contain extreme adult (NSFW) content in order to make player agency achievable. However, this demo may have a toggle option to censor adult content in the future.

Any players that wish to contribute to development can contact me @thearchmagedev@gmail.com

Note: This project is greatly inspired by Zork. Interactive Fiction engines give players a great deal of agency, but generally lack a developed narrative. Visual novels contain developed narratives but often rob players of their agency. My dream is to combine these elements in a single project.
