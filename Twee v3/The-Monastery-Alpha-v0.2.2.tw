/* 

Test: 

Infirmary syntax fix
Transformation Potion Effects

Unfinished Tasks: 
Incorporate different options at night

Access to medicine cabinet if you treat patients successfully and earn the nurse's trust

Incorporate X-ray Potion effect

Prioritize unseen hints

Polish blind dorm exploration

Prevent player from entering menu to drink potions to prevent loss - Feature or bug?
Petrified NPCs are stuck in the area after being petrified. Update area descriptions.

Drinking certain potions should nullify the effects of other potions; i.e. certain transformations may be incompatible with one another

Isolate Fresh conditionals

Harvest buttons should take player to a passage that explains they have harvested and then bring them back to the harvest screen.

Determine the number of NPCs

Incorporate teacher item effects

Incorporate Potion effects
Establish NPCs/relationships
Incorporate Statue power into all relationships - Multiple endings for each relationship depending on situation??
Incorporate events that occur if player doesn't take an action in a certain amount of time 
Inspecting the stained glass foreshadows certain endings; begin with randomization; consider filtering based on available endings
Figure out $SirenPet mechanics, filters all future options if true based on the siren's preferences, provides options that wouldn't  normally exist to lead to unique endings based on other pre-existing boolean variable values
Create separate passage for exploring campus at night? Requires night vision?
Create mechanic for collecting/ingesting secret bath water
Expand library options

Consider limiting number of items obtained by daydreaming

Too many bad ends in bath house

Check fresh for history control. Does fresh work when going back and forth between passages? Add fresh tag to passages?

Changelog v0.2.2
-The teacher's important document can now be found in the desk even if a previous search attempt failed
-Potions have effects (6/25: X-ray Potion, Poison, Disintegration Potion, Gorgon Potion, Invisibility Potion, & Blindness Potion)
-Syntax bugfix in Infirmary

Bug Log 
-Planting a seed and then opening the inventory gives the player a misleading text when returning to the passage because the seed has been removed from the inventory, allows player to plant all seeds without incrementing time
-History control causes $Temp to bug out and not randomize in the teacher's dorm when searching belongings (Test)
-If player has all seeds, They find an error plant
-Menu disappeared while invisible; Corrects on [[Demo]]

:: Examine Potion [menu noreturn]
You examine the $Temp.
<<switch $Temp>>
    <<case 'Gorgon Potion'>>
        A green liquid swirls around inside the phial. Quiet hissing noises escape every so often.
    <<case 'Invisibility Potion'>>
        The phial is entirely transparent. You can't see any liquid but you can hear it splash if you shake the phial.
    <<case 'Blinding Potion'>>
        It is entirely pitch black.
    <<case 'Vision Potion'>>
        The liquid is an opaque milky color. 

        Every so often, a darker image of an eyeball appears in the liquid, flittering around inside the phial as if searching for something and then disappears. 
    <<case 'Love Potion'>>
        The liquid is a pleasant pink color.
    <<case 'X-ray Potion'>>
        The liquid in the phial strobes periodically between black, white, and transparent.
    <<case 'Philosophy Potion'>>
        The potion is perfectly normal and mundane in appearance.
    <<case 'Vampire Potion'>>
        Deep black and red colors swirl inside the phial, as if playing with one another.
    <<case 'Undead Potion'>>
        The phial contains a rather viscous and chunky green substance.
    <<case 'Succubus Potion'>>
        The phial contains a swirling purple liquid which forms the shape of a devilish grin occasionally. 
    <<case 'Incubus Potion'>>
        The phial contains a swirling purple liquid which forms the shape of a devilish grin occasionally.
    <<case 'Bat Potion'>>
        The liquid is a black color. 
    <<case 'Curse Potion'>>
        You remove the phial stopper. A puff of smoke rises and forms into the shape of a skull as it dissipates into the air.
    <<case 'Nightmare Potion'>>
        As you peer into the phial, a disturbing image takes shape before your eyes. 

        You quickly put the phial away.
    <<case 'Lust Potion'>>
        The liquid is a bright pink color. The phial gives you goosebumps when you hold it. 
    <<case 'Demon Potion'>>
        The liquid is a dark red color. The phial feels warm to the touch.
    <<case 'Depression Potion'>>
        It appears bleak and unassuming.
    <<case 'Temporary Death Potion'>>
        You hear a slight clicking noise periodically.
    <<case 'Intangibility Potion'>>
        It appears relatively normal. 

        While holding it, you attempt to touch it with your other hand and it passes right through the phial. 
    <<case 'Gargoyle Potion'>>
        The grey contents remain perfectly still, no matter how you twist and turn the phial. 

        It is clearly a liquid however as you can see flecks moving about internally.
    <<case 'Octopus Potion'>>
        The liquid changes color to match it's environment when in contact with a surface.

        As you swirl it around, the liquid sticks to the phial.   
    <<case 'Disintegration Potion'>>
        The dark purple liquid is suspended inside the phial, not making contact with the glass at all.

        The liquid sphere pulsates, compressing and decompressing with each pulse. You can feel the phial vibrate slightly with each compression. 
    <<case 'Slime Potion'>>
        It is goopy and green.
    <<case 'Poison'>>
        It is standard poison.
    <<case 'Truth Serum'>>
        A beautiful silver liquid swirls around the vial, producing mesmerizing striations.
    <<case 'Holy Water'>>
        It looks like normal water.
    <<default>>
        It looks like $Temp in a phial.

This demo provides players with a teaser for the main project. It is intended to display gameplay without widening the scope to unwieldy levels inevitably required for developing the main project.

    You spent your time on campus doing a whole lot of nothing. Maybe you could have been more interesting or taken more risks.

    Despite the fact that you had high hopes for your life after school, you turned out entirely ordinarily and accomplished nothing noteworthy for the rest of your life.

    On the bright side, at least you didn't really screw anything up either. That's an accomplishment of sorts.

    It's the small things in life that count, right...?

As you stand up, a furious hoof makes direct contact with your temple killing you instantly.

The horse continues kicking around hay and unintentionally covers your body, concealing it.

You are not found until you begin smelling bad. And nobody noticed you were missing either.

    Much to your surprise, she walks directly towards you and taps on your shoulder, letting out nothing but a grunt.

    A bead of sweat runs down your brow.
