The Monastery is a demo for "The Archmage", an in-development text adventure fantasy game.

The Monastery provides players with a teaser for the main project. It displays gameplay mechanics without widening the scope to the unwieldy levels of the main project.

Notes: This project is inspired by Zork & Colossal Cave Adventure. Interactive Fiction engines give players a great deal of agency, but generally lack a developed narrative. Visual novels contain developed narratives but often rob players of their agency. My dream is to combine these elements in a single project.
