:: Dormitory
You enter the dormitory.

The hallway forks. One direction leads to the male dorm, the other leads to the female dorm. You also notice a latch on the ceiling with a warning sign warning you not to pull it.

[[Male dorm]]
[[Female dorm]]
[[Pull latch]]


:: Temple
You enter the temple.

This is probably the most magnificent room in the entire campus. It is open and spacious, but also majestically decorated.

The stained glass windows depict epic scenes in glorious colors as sunlight shines through, flooding the room. 

Wooden pews line the stone floors and an imposing statue watches over the space.

[[Pray to the statue]]
[[Search the temple]]


:: Cloister
You enter the cloister.

There is a large tree in the center of the field surrounded by a large patch of open grass. Four walls surround the area in a square shape. Various bushes and flowers line the walls. 

[[Inspect the plants]]
[[Daydream]]


:: Refectory
You enter the refectory.

The vacuous hall has two long wooden dining tables that extend the length of the room. Atop the tables lie lace tablecloths with chalices and dishes placed intermittently. In the center, a few candles burn. 

The stone floor is immaculate and the ceiling meets at a point with wooden rafters clearly visible. The walls are bare, giving the room an orderly and prestigious air.


:: Library
You enter the library.

You notice many bookshelves and various students spread out across the room, diligently studying in silence. 

[[Study]]
[[Interrupt another student]]
[[Find a librarian]]


:: Laboratory
You enter the laboratory.

There are beakers, test tubes, and other unrecognizable instruments neatly and fastidiously arranged around the room.

You notice a metal chamber that has been locked shut. There must be an experiment in progress.



:: Balneary
You enter the balneary.

There is a large fountain in the middle of the room and a sink that spans across the entire back wall.

:: Infirmary
You enter the infirmary.

There are a few beds with sheets hanging beside them and a closed door that you suspect is most likely an office.

You notice a tray with various medical tools strewn across, such as a scalpel, thermometer, and needles. 


:: Barn
You enter the barn.

You open up the large doors and swing them on their hinges. As the doors swing open, they reveal the animals to you. 

You notice horses in their stables. Cows, sheep, and pigs in their pens. Chickens in their coup. Dogs in their kennels. However, there are no people to be seen. 



[[Look for a person]] 
[[Approach the animals]]


:: Forge
You enter the forge.

You see an anvil and a hulking furnace. Various tools such as tongs and hammers are strewn across the floor and workbench. 

Whoever used them last must not be too organized.


:: Brewery
You enter the brewery.

This is where the magic happens. The students love the reprieve of refreshing ale after a hard day's work. 

You see kettles, kegs, a boiler, tanks, and ingredients such as mash. 


:: Class
You sit down in an empty chair in the classroom and wait for class to start. There are no students or teachers in sight.

After waiting for a few minutes, you become impatient. 

<i> Is anybody else coming...?</i>

[[Wait Patiently]]
[[Search the Classroom]]

:: Introduction
This is a demo for the currently in-development interactive fiction project "The Archmage".

:: Wait Patiently
You figure that scouring through random items in the classroom might not be a good idea, so you decide to wait for class to start...

Eventually, students begin filtering into the classroom, and settling into their respective seats. 

A large, muscular brute of a man walks through the door. His school uniform doesn't seem to fit him quite right as certain muscles on his body bulge out, stretching the fabric in odd places. You chuckle quietly at the sight of him, but do your best to contain the noise since you imagine he could easily smash your skull should he ever decide to...

Much to your surprise, he walks directly towards you and taps on your shoulder, letting out nothing but a grunt.

A bead of sweat runs down your brow. 

<i> Did he hear my laughter?</i>

:: Horse
You walk up to the stables and notice a few horses. One of them is clearly a stallion. 

[[Enter stable]] 
[[Stroke horse’s head]]

:: Enter stable
You enter the stallion’s stable. You walk around carefully, observing his body. He is large and muscular, with some bulging veins. He stands proudly and majestically, seemingly not noticing you. 

[[Walk around behind him]] 
[[Exit stable]]


:: Stroke horse’s head
Double-click this passage to edit it.

:: Walk around behind him
You carefully walk around behind the tall beast, being especially careful not to spook him and take an unexpected kick to the chest. He must have noticed you, because suddenly his cock begins to grow. 

You can see it dangling between his legs underneath his large balls. As it grows, it stands up, gradually moving out of your line sight as it hardens underneath his chest. 

[[Play with him]] 
[[Exit stable]]


:: Exit stable
You decide to exit the stable, leaving the horse behind.

[[Look for a person]] 

[[Approach the animals]]

:: Play with him
You slowly reach underneath him and grab hold of his massive horse cock. You can feel it pulsing in your hands. It is warm and powerful. You begin slowly stroking and you notice him whinny, seemingly in pleasure. His l;arge balls begin to slowly rise towards his body as you work on his cock. You gently squeeze on his balls with your other hand, feeling the massive amount of storage for jizz. 

[[Play with ass]] 
[[Suck cock]]


:: Play with ass

:: Suck cock
You slowly slide underneath his belly and taste his cock. It is now slightly wet and his precum oozes out onto your tongue. 

You stroke his hard member with both of your hands. You open your mouth and envelope the tip around your lips, sucking gently back and forth as you coax out more precum onto your tongue and swallow it down once it builds up in your mouth. 

You take the horse cock deeper, filling the back of your mouth as you stroke with more fervor. You notice that he is getting more excited. His hips begin to shake every so often as he thrusts slightly into your throat. 

Suddenly, he neighs loudly and thrusts deeply into the back of your throat. His cock slides past your tongue and down your gullet. As you take the majority of his cock into your mouth and throat, his cock begins to pulsate. He shoots his warm, sticky load into your throat.
