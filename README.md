This is a demo for the currently in-development interactive fiction project "The Archmage", a project intended to be a narrative-driven interactive fiction fantasy which provides the player with _significant_ agency.

This demo provides players with a teaser for the main project without spoiling major story elements. It is intended to display gameplay mechanics without widening the scope (and timeline) to unwieldy levels inevitably required for developing the main project. 

The final version of the demo will contain: Multiple Endings, Replayability, Environmental Interactions, and Basic Agency. 

The main project will contain _extreme_ adult (NSFW) content in order to make player agency actually achievable. However, this demo will not contain any of that content.

Any players that wish to report bugs or ask questions can contact me @thearchmagedev@gmail.com

Note: This project is greatly inspired by Zork. Interactive Fiction engines give players a great deal of agency, but generally lack a developed narrative. Visual novels contain developed narratives but often rob players of their agency. My dream is to combine these elements in a single project. 

Current Version: Alpha V0.0
Description: Passages, Endings, and Interactions are currently under development.

Next Version: Alpha V0.1
Upcoming Features: _Basic_ Player Agency, Multiple Endings, and numerous Interactions
